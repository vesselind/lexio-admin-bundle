description: Run the full PM, architecture, implementation, and QA workflow for new bundle functionality. Use when a user explicitly requests the feature workflow or types /feature.

# Feature Pipeline

> Full pipeline (PM→Architect→Dev→QA) for new functionality.
> **Invoke when:** user explicitly types `/feature` or requests the feature workflow.
> **Never auto-apply.**

Full orchestration for implementing new functionality: PM scopes requirements, Architect designs, Main agent implements layer by layer and automatically triggers QA verification. User validates between PM→Architect and after QA.

## When to Use

- User explicitly types `/feature` or asks for the feature workflow
- User describes a new feature or functionality to add
- Do NOT use when: user reports a bug (use `/bug-fix`), mentions refactoring or code smell (use `/refactor`), or asks for a quick change without the full pipeline

## Instructions

### Phase 0: Initial Clarification

Before launching the PM subagent, ask the user to confirm:
- "Do you have an issue tracker ticket ID or story link (e.g., Jira, Redmine) for this feature?"
- "What is the primary user benefit of this feature?"
- "Are there existing features or APIs this work extends or replaces?"
- "What constraints (performance, security, backward compatibility) should we consider?"

### Phase 1: PM Subagent (Requirements)

Launch the PM subagent (read `../../agents/pm.md` for persona) with the task:

1. Scope requirements — understand the full ask, identify stakeholders and user roles
2. Ask clarifying questions aggressively to surface edge cases, acceptance criteria, and error scenarios
3. Define acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
4. Document edge cases and expected behavior for each
5. Produce specification and save to `docs/stories/FEAT-NNN-slug.md`

**Output:** Structured spec with user stories, acceptance criteria, edge cases, out-of-scope items.

**User validation gate:** STOP. Present the spec to the user. Ask: "Does this specification accurately capture your requirements? Should we add, remove, or clarify anything before the Architect designs the solution?" Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until the user confirms.

### Phase 2: Architect Subagent (Technical Design)

Launch the Architect subagent (read `../../agents/architect.md` for persona) in **readonly** mode with the task:

1. Read the PM specification from `docs/stories/`
2. Explore the existing codebase — detect patterns, layer structure, naming conventions
3. Design from scratch: for a **bundle**, implementation order = config Extension → services (XML/loadExtension) → public Contract/events → tests (minimal Kernel) → optional Doctrine/API/UX per `../../rules/architecture.md` and `../../rules/symfony-bundle.md`
4. Select applicable rules — list which rules from `../../rules/` the main agent MUST read before implementing
5. Save the design to `docs/handoffs/FEAT-NNN-architecture.md`

**Output:** Technical design with components, implementation order, applicable rules list, risks.

**User validation gate:** STOP. Present the design to the user. Ask: "Does this technical approach work for you? Any concerns about the proposed architecture?" Do NOT proceed to Phase 3 until the user approves.

### Phase 3: Main Agent (Implementation & Verification)

You (the main agent) implement. Do NOT delegate implementation to a subagent.

1. Read every rule listed in the Architect's "Applicable Rules" section — load each rule file before coding
2. Implement layer by layer following the Architect's implementation order exactly
3. After each layer, run `make ci` — fix any issues before proceeding
4. Follow the Architect's bundle layer sequence (typically: config/services → Contract/public API → implementation → tests; add Entity/Repository/API only if in scope)
5. Use only `make` commands — never raw composer, php, phpunit, phpstan, or cs-fixer

**Layer verification:** After each layer, run `make ci`. If it fails, fix before continuing.

**Final Verification (QA):** Once all layers are implemented, automatically launch the QA subagent (read `../../agents/qa.md` for persona) with the task:
1. Run `make ci` — report pass/fail
2. Full acceptance: compare implementation against PM spec — all criteria met? edge cases covered?
3. Rule compliance: verify code follows each applicable rule from the Architect's list
4. Produce structured verdict: APPROVED / NEEDS CHANGES / REJECTED

**Output:** QA review with verdict, quality checks, specification compliance, rule compliance, issues found.

**User validation gate:** Present QA results to the user. If NEEDS CHANGES or REJECTED, address issues and re-run QA. Only conclude when QA approves and the user validates.

## Exit Checklist (MANDATORY before concluding)

- [ ] PM specification saved to `docs/stories/`
- [ ] Architect design saved to `docs/handoffs/`
- [ ] User validated spec before Architect phase
- [ ] User validated design before implementation
- [ ] All layers implemented in order with `make ci` passing after each
- [ ] QA subagent launched automatically and approved the implementation
- [ ] User validated final result
- [ ] `make ci` passes

## On Failure

- If PM spec is rejected: return to Phase 1, ask clarifying questions, revise spec, re-present for validation
- If Architect design is rejected: return to Phase 2, adjust design, re-present for validation
- If `make ci` fails during implementation: fix the reported issues, re-run `make ci`, do not proceed to next layer until green
- If QA rejects: address each reported issue, re-implement as needed, re-launch QA subagent
- If stuck after 3 attempts in any phase: ask the user for guidance
