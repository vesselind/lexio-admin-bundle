# Quality Install — Setup Quality Tooling

> Setup quality tooling in a Symfony bundle package repo (PHPStan, CS-Fixer/Pint, Deptrac, Infection, GrumPHP).
> **Invoke when:** user explicitly types `/quality-install`. Never auto-apply.

Setup the full quality pipeline in a **Symfony bundle** package (typically `src/` + `tests/`): PHPStan level 9, PHP-CS-Fixer or Pint, Deptrac, Infection, GrumPHP. Creates configuration files and the three Makefile targets (quality, tests, ci).

**Use the files in this skill's `templates/` folder as the single reference** — copy and adapt to the project; do not duplicate their content in the skill or in rules. The rule `../../rules/quality-pipeline.md` defines the contract (three targets, semantics); the templates provide the implementation.

## When to Use

- User explicitly types `/quality-install` or requests quality tooling setup
- User wants to add PHPStan, CS-Fixer, Deptrac, Infection, or GrumPHP to their project
- Do NOT use when: user asks for a feature, bug fix, or onboarding (use the relevant skill)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Ask What's Already Installed (or Detect)

Ask the user:
- "Which quality tools do you already have? PHPStan, PHP-CS-Fixer, Pint, Deptrac, Infection, GrumPHP?"
- Alternatively, read `composer.json` to detect: `phpstan/phpstan`, `friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer` or `laravel/pint`, `deptrac/deptrac` (not qossmic/deptrac-shim), `infection/infection`, `phpro/grumphp`
- If detection is ambiguous, ask the user to confirm

### Step 2: Install Missing Tools

For each tool not present, add via Composer. Use only `make` commands if the project has a Makefile with `composer require` targets. Otherwise, instruct the user to run the appropriate commands (this skill does not contain PHP/YAML — the agent runs `composer require` as a one-time setup step, or the project may have `make deps` / similar).

**Tools to ensure:**
- **PHPStan** — level 9, no baseline
- **PHP-CS-Fixer** or **Pint** — code style
- **Deptrac** — use `deptrac/deptrac` only; do NOT install `qossmic/deptrac-shim` (abandoned)
- **Infection** — mutation testing
- **GrumPHP** — pre-commit hooks

Reference `../../rules/quality-pipeline.md` for version and config requirements.

### Step 3: Create or Update Makefile Targets (3 targets only)

Ensure the project has exactly these three targets (in the root Makefile or in **Makefile-solution** if the root Makefile `include`s it):
- `make quality` — lint, Deptrac, PHPStan, CS check (all quality tools)
- `make tests` — PHPUnit, Infection (all test tools)
- `make ci` — full pipeline (quality + tests; optionally composer audit)

**Makefile-solution:** If the root Makefile includes `Makefile-solution`, add or edit these targets in Makefile-solution only. Use the `templates/Makefile` in this skill as reference — copy and adapt to the project (paths, Docker, etc.).

### Step 4: Create Configuration Files (from templates)

Create or update config files by **copying from this skill's `templates/` folder** and adapting to the project (paths, excludePaths, layers). Do not redefine file contents in the skill or in the rule — the templates are the single source of truth for implementation.

- `templates/phpstan.neon.dist` → phpstan.neon (level 9)
- `templates/.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` → .php-cs-fixer.dist.php or Pint config
- `templates/deptrac.yaml` → deptrac.yaml
- `templates/grumphp.yml` → grumphp.yml (pre-commit calls `make quality`)
- `templates/infection.json5` → infection.json5
- `templates/phpunit.xml.dist` → phpunit.xml.dist if needed

Read `../../rules/quality-pipeline.md` for the contract (PHPStan level 9, no baseline, Infection MSI, etc.); use templates for the actual file content.

### Step 5: Run make ci to Verify

Run `make ci` (or the equivalent target). If it fails:
- Fix reported issues (security-check, PHPStan errors, CS violations, tests)
- Re-run until `make ci` passes
- If failures persist after 3 attempts, ask the user for guidance

### Step 6: Reference quality-pipeline.md

Before concluding, ensure the agent has read `../../rules/quality-pipeline.md` for:
- PHPStan level 9, no baseline
- CS-Fixer or Pint rules
- Deptrac layer definitions
- Infection MSI target (≥70%)
- GrumPHP task configuration
- Max 3 retry attempts then ask for help

## Exit Checklist (MANDATORY before concluding)

- [ ] User confirmed or agent detected what's already installed
- [ ] PHPStan (L9), CS-Fixer/Pint, Deptrac, Infection, GrumPHP installed
- [ ] Makefile (or Makefile-solution if used) has `make quality`, `make tests`, `make ci`
- [ ] Config files created: phpstan.neon, .php-cs-fixer.dist.php or pint config, deptrac.yaml, grumphp.yml, infection.json5
- [ ] `make ci` passes
- [ ] Agent has read quality-pipeline.md

## On Failure

- If composer require fails (e.g. version conflict): ask user to resolve dependency constraints, suggest compatible versions from quality-pipeline.md
- If make ci fails: fix security/quality/test issues, re-run; after 3 attempts, ask user for guidance
- If GrumPHP fails to install or configure: document manual setup steps, suggest running `make ci` before each commit as fallback
- If Infection takes too long or times out: suggest lowering mutation counts for initial setup, or running Infection only in CI
- If stuck after 3 attempts: ask the user for guidance
