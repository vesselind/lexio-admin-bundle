# Refactor Pipeline

> Safe refactoring with coverage-first approach. Add missing tests first, then refactor in small verified steps.
> **Can auto-invoke** when the user mentions code smell, SOLID violations, technical debt, or requests refactoring.

Safe refactoring pipeline: PM identifies the code smell or SOLID violation and risk, Architect designs a safe path and fills coverage gaps first, Main agent adds tests then refactors in small verified steps and triggers QA to confirm behavioral equivalence and SOLID respect.

## When to Use

- User mentions code smell, technical debt, or "this should be refactored"
- User references SOLID, DRY, Single Responsibility, or similar principles
- User wants to improve structure without changing behavior
- Can auto-invoke when the user clearly describes a refactoring need
- Do NOT use when: user reports a bug (use `/bug-fix`) or wants new functionality (use `/feature`)

## Instructions

### Phase 0: Scope the Refactor

Ask the user to clarify:
- "What specific code smell or principle violation are you addressing?"
- "What are the affected boundaries (class, module, layer)?"
- "Is behavioral change acceptable, or must behavior remain identical?"

### Phase 1: PM Subagent (Assess & Risk)

Launch the PM subagent (read `ai-new/agents/pm.md` for persona) with the task:

1. Identify the code smell or SOLID violation — name it (e.g. "God class", "Feature envy", "violates SRP")
2. Map affected boundaries — which classes, modules, or layers are involved?
3. Risk assessment — what could break? which areas lack test coverage?
4. Document scope and constraints — behavior must remain equivalent unless user approves otherwise

**Output:** Code smell analysis, affected boundaries, risk map, scope constraints.

### Phase 2: Architect Subagent (Safe Path)

Launch the Architect subagent (read `ai-new/agents/architect.md` for persona) in **readonly** mode with the task:

1. Design a safe refactoring path — small, incremental steps, each verifiable
2. Identify test coverage gaps — what must be covered BEFORE refactoring?
3. Specify which tests to add first — unit, integration, or characterization tests
4. Apply SOLID principles — which principle(s) will the refactor satisfy?
5. List applicable rules from `ai-new/rules/` (e.g. `coding-standards.md`, `architecture.md`, `testing.md`)
6. Define the sequence: [add test A] → [refactor step 1] → [run tests] → [refactor step 2] → …

**Output:** Refactoring plan with coverage gaps to fill, step sequence, applicable rules.

### Phase 3: Main Agent (Coverage First, Refactor & QA)

You (the main agent) implement. Coverage before refactor is mandatory.

1. Read `ai-new/rules/coding-standards.md`, `ai-new/rules/testing.md`, and any rules the Architect listed
2. Add missing test coverage FIRST — fill gaps identified by the Architect
3. Run `make tests` — all tests pass, new tests document current behavior
4. Refactor in small steps — one change at a time
5. After EACH refactoring step: run `make tests` — if any test fails, revert or fix immediately
6. Run `make ci` after completing all steps

**Critical rule:** Never refactor without adequate tests. Never take a step that breaks tests without immediately addressing it.

**Final Verification (QA):** Once all steps are complete, automatically launch the QA subagent (read `ai-new/agents/qa.md` for persona) with the task:
1. Behavioral equivalence — do the same tests pass before and after? no new failures
2. SOLID respect — verify the refactored code adheres to the targeted principle(s)
3. No new dependencies — did the refactor introduce unnecessary coupling or new dependencies?
4. Rule compliance — does the code follow `ai-new/rules/coding-standards.md` and other applicable rules?
5. Run `make ci` — report pass/fail
6. Produce verdict: APPROVED / NEEDS CHANGES / REJECTED

**Output:** QA review with verdict, behavioral equivalence check, SOLID compliance, dependency check.

**User validation:** Present results. If behavior changed unintentionally, revert and add more tests. If QA rejects, address issues and re-run QA.

## Exit Checklist (MANDATORY before concluding)

- [ ] Code smell / SOLID violation identified and documented
- [ ] Missing test coverage added BEFORE refactoring
- [ ] Refactored in small steps with `make tests` after EACH step
- [ ] All tests pass — behavioral equivalence maintained
- [ ] `make ci` passes
- [ ] QA subagent launched automatically and confirmed behavioral equivalence and SOLID compliance
- [ ] No new unnecessary dependencies introduced

## On Failure

- If tests fail mid-refactor: do not proceed — revert the last step, add more tests, or fix the refactor
- If behavior changes unintentionally: revert, add characterization or regression tests, then retry refactor
- If SOLID is violated after refactor: the refactor missed the goal — re-read Architect's plan, adjust approach
- If `make ci` fails: address reported issues, re-run until green
- If stuck after 3 attempts: ask the user for guidance
