name: create-branch
description: Create or switch to a Git branch with a type prefix and kebab-case name. Use when a user asks to create a branch, start new work, or needs isolation from the default branch.
---

# Create Branch

> Create a Git branch with type prefix and kebab-case slug.
> **Use when:** the user asks to create a branch, start new work, or when `/commit` detects work on main/master.

## When to Use

- User asks to create, start, or switch to a new branch
- `/commit` detected work on `main`/`master` and redirected here
- Starting new work that needs isolation

## When NOT to Use

- Already on a feature branch — use `/commit` instead
- Exploring or reading code — no branch needed

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Work

If the user described the work, use that as the starting point.

If no description provided, check for local changes:

```bash
git diff --stat
git diff --cached --stat
git status --short
```

- **Changes exist**: read the diff to infer what the work is about and generate a description.
- **No changes**: ask the user — "What are you about to work on?" and "Is this a feature, bug fix, refactor, or something else?"

### Step 2: Classify the Branch Type

| Type       | When                                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | New user-facing functionality                 |
| `fix`      | Broken behavior that needs correction         |
| `refactor` | Same behavior, different structure            |
| `chore`    | Dependencies, config, maintenance             |
| `perf`     | Same behavior, faster                         |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                            |
| `test`     | Tests only                                    |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration                           |
| `style`    | Formatting, code style — no logic change      |

When unsure, challenge the user: "This sounds like it could be `feat` or `refactor` — which describes the intent better?"

### Step 3: Propose the Branch Name

Build as `<type>/<short-kebab-description>`:
- 3–6 words, kebab-case, lowercase ASCII + hyphens only
- Describe the change, not file names
- No spaces, dots, colons, or git-forbidden characters

Examples:

| Work description                           | Branch name                          |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Adding search to conversations page        | `feat/add-search-to-conversations`   |
| Dropdown not closing on outside click      | `fix/dropdown-not-closing-on-blur`   |
| Restructuring drawer components            | `refactor/simplify-drawer-components`|
| Adding a CSV export endpoint               | `feat/add-csv-export-endpoint`       |

If the upcoming work involves specific Symfony components, mention which `../../rules/*.md` rules will be relevant — this helps plan scope.

**Present the name to the user and wait for confirmation.** Adapt if they request changes.

### Step 4: Detect Base and Prepare

Detect current and default branches:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'
```

If `symbolic-ref` fails, fall back to `git branch --list main master` — use whichever exists. If both or neither, ask the user.

**Detached HEAD** (empty `git branch --show-current`): show the current commit (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`) and ask whether to branch from it or switch to the default branch first.

**Not on default branch**: warn the user and ask whether to branch from the current branch or switch to the default branch first.

**Dirty working tree**: offer to stash (`git stash push -m "create-branch: auto-stash"`). On any failure, restore stash and stop.

### Step 5: Create

Verify the name is available locally and remotely:

```bash
git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/<name> && echo "exists-local"
git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/<name> && echo "exists-remote"
```

If taken, propose an alternative. Then create:

```bash
git checkout -b <name>
```

Restore any stashed changes. Confirm with `git branch --show-current`.

## Exit Checklist

- [ ] Branch name proposed and confirmed by user
- [ ] Branch created and checked out (`git branch --show-current`)
- [ ] No uncommitted changes lost (stashed and restored if needed)

## On Failure

- Branch already exists: propose alternative with different wording or suffix
- Stash restore fails: alert user and show `git stash list`
- Stuck after 3 attempts: ask the user for guidance
