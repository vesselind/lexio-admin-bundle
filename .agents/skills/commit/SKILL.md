# Commit

> Validate quality, commit, and push changes following Conventional Commits.
> **Use when:** the user wants to commit, push, finalize work, or says "commit", "push", "save my changes".

## When to Use

- User wants to commit and/or push changes
- Finalizing a feature, fix, or refactor
- User says "commit", "push", "save changes", or similar

## When NOT to Use

- No changes to commit (empty working tree)
- User just wants to see the diff

## Prohibited

- DO NOT commit on `main` or `master` — invoke `/create-branch` first.
- DO NOT force push (`--force`) without explicit user confirmation.
- DO NOT commit messages in a language other than English.
- DO NOT commit sensitive files (`.env`, `.env.local`, credentials, secrets, API keys, tokens) without alerting the user.
- DO NOT omit the type prefix (Conventional Commits).

## Instructions

### Step 1: Branch Protection (MANDATORY)

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

If on `main` or `master`: invoke `/create-branch`. After it completes, verify the branch changed. If still on `main`/`master` (user aborted), **STOP**.

### Step 2: Review Changes

Run `git status` and `git diff --stat`. Challenge:
- "These changes touch [N] files. Should this be one commit or split into smaller logical units?"
- "I see changes to [sensitive area]. Was this intentional?"

**Security check**: scan staged files for patterns: `.env`, `credentials`, `secret`, `token`, `password`, `apikey`, `private_key`. If found, alert the user immediately and `git reset HEAD <file>`.

### Step 3: Quality Gate

Run `make ci` to verify the full CI pipeline (security-check + quality + tests). Conventions are defined in `ai-new/rules/quality-pipeline.md`.

If `make ci` does not exist, warn the user and suggest `/quality-install`.

If `make ci` fails: analyze error, fix, retry (max 3 attempts). If still failing, ask user.

### Step 4: Build the Commit Message

**Header** (required): `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

| Type       | When                                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | New feature                                   |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                       |
| `refactor` | Refactoring (no behavior change)              |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                       |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                            |
| `test`     | Test additions or corrections                 |
| `build`    | Build system or dependencies                  |
| `ci`       | CI configuration                              |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks                             |
| `style`    | Code formatting (no logic change)             |

Subject rules: imperative present tense ("Add feature" not "Added"), capitalize first letter, no period, max 70 chars. Scope is optional.

**Body** (recommended for non-trivial changes): explain **what** and **why**, not how. Use imperative mood. Contrast with previous behavior when relevant.

**Footer** (optional):
- `Fixes #NNN` — closes the issue when merged
- `Refs #NNN` — links without closing
- `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` — add `!` after type/scope in header too

If the user provided intent in another language, translate to English.

**Examples:**

Simple fix:
```
fix(api): Handle null response in user endpoint
```

Feature with body:
```
feat(alerts): Add Slack thread replies for alert updates

Post replies to the original Slack thread instead of creating new
messages. Keeps related notifications grouped.

Refs #1234
```

Breaking change:
```
feat(api)!: Remove deprecated v1 endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: v1 endpoints no longer available
Fixes #9999
```

### Step 5: Commit and Push

1. Stage relevant files (`git add .` if user confirms, or selective add)
2. Commit with the message (use HEREDOC for multi-line)
3. Push — `git push -u origin HEAD` if no upstream

Confirm success: show commit hash and remote status.

## Troubleshooting

**`make ci` fails (PHPStan):** fix the type issue. Never add to baseline — fix all errors.

**`make ci` fails (CS-Fixer):** fix code style (e.g. run the project's formatter if available), then re-stage.

**`make ci` fails (Deptrac):** dependency crosses architectural layer. Refactor or document exception.

**Push rejected (non-fast-forward):** run `git pull --rebase origin <branch>`, resolve conflicts if any, then push again.

**Sensitive file staged:** `git reset HEAD <file>`, add to `.gitignore` if it should never be committed.

## Principles

- Each commit is a single, stable, independently reviewable change
- The repository is in a working state after each commit
- Quality gate passed before every commit

## Exit Checklist

- [ ] Branch is NOT `main`/`master`
- [ ] `make ci` passed (or user warned if unavailable)
- [ ] No sensitive files committed
- [ ] Commit message follows Conventional Commits (English, imperative)
- [ ] Changes pushed to remote

## On Failure

- `make ci` fails: fix and retry, max 3 attempts then ask user
- Push rejected (non-fast-forward): pull with rebase then push
- Push fails (no upstream): `git push -u origin HEAD`
- Stuck after 3 attempts: ask the user for guidance
