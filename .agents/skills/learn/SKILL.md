# Learn — Extract Lessons Learned

> Extract lessons from the current conversation and append to docs/lessons-learned.md.
> **Can auto-invoke** when the user says "lesson", "what did we learn", "capture this", or asks to document takeaways.

Extract actionable lessons from the current conversation and append them to `docs/lessons-learned.md` in a structured format. Enables retroactive learning and avoids repeating mistakes.

## When to Use

- User says "lesson", "what did we learn", "capture this", "document takeaways"
- User asks to extract lessons from the conversation
- Can auto-invoke when the user explicitly requests lesson extraction
- Do NOT use when: user asks for feature, bug fix, or other workflow (use the relevant skill)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Ask User What to Capture

Ask the user:
- "Which aspects of this conversation should I capture? For example: bugs encountered, architecture decisions, patterns discovered, gotchas, performance insights, security considerations."
- If the conversation was long: "Should I focus on specific parts (e.g. the refactoring phase, the bug fix) or the whole conversation?"

### Step 2: Review Conversation History

Review the full conversation history. Identify:
- **Bugs encountered** — what went wrong, root cause, fix applied
- **Architecture decisions** — choices made and rationale
- **Patterns discovered** — conventions or approaches that worked well
- **Gotchas** — non-obvious pitfalls, edge cases, tool quirks
- **Performance insights** — bottlenecks, optimizations, trade-offs
- **Security considerations** — vulnerabilities discussed, mitigations

### Step 3: Extract Lessons in Structured Format

For each lesson, structure as:
- **Date** (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Context** — brief summary of the situation
- **Lesson** — what was learned
- **Impact** — how this affects future work (optional)

### Step 4: Append to docs/lessons-learned.md

Append the extracted lessons to `docs/lessons-learned.md`. If the file does not exist, create it with a header and the first entry. Use a consistent markdown structure (e.g. ## YYYY-MM-DD or ### Lesson blocks). No code blocks unless strictly necessary for the lesson (prefer references to files or `ai-new/rules/` rules).

### Step 5: Challenge Retroactively

Ask the user:
- "Would you like to challenge any decision we made during this conversation? Anything you'd do differently in hindsight?"
- If the user identifies a decision to revisit: add it as a lesson with the format "Retrospective: [decision] — reconsider because [reason]"

## Exit Checklist (MANDATORY before concluding)

- [ ] User confirmed which aspects to capture
- [ ] Conversation history reviewed
- [ ] Lessons extracted in structured format (date, context, lesson, impact)
- [ ] docs/lessons-learned.md created or appended
- [ ] User asked about retrospective challenges

## On Failure

- If docs/ directory does not exist: create it, then create lessons-learned.md
- If conversation has no extractable lessons: ask user "This conversation didn't surface obvious lessons. Would you like me to document the workflow we followed for future reference?"
- If user provides conflicting feedback on what to capture: prioritize their explicit choices, summarize the rest as optional addendum
- If stuck after 3 attempts: ask the user for guidance
